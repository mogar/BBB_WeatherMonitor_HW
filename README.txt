These are the hardware design files for a BBB Cape that monitors weather conditions.

See also this repo for example code:

These hardware files were created with KiCAD. You may need the KiCAD libraries available here: https://github.com/mogar/KiCAD_libs When opening these projects in KiCAD, you may need to change the path to the libraries from the above link. This can be done in preferences->libraries in both the schematic editor and the layout editor. Make sure the libraries noted there point to wherever you put the above KiCAD_libs repo.
